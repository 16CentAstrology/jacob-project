<h3>What is EMF?</h3>
<blockquote>
The Eclipse Modeling Framework is a Java/XML framework for generating tools and other applications based on simple class models. EMF helps you rapidly turn models into efficient, correct, and easily customizable Java code. It is intended to provide the benefits of formal modeling, but with a very low cost of entry. In addition to code generation, it provides the ability to save objects as XML documents for interchange with other tools and applications. Models can be created using annotated Java, XML documents, or modeling tools like Rational Rose, then imported into EMF. The code generator turns a model into a set of Java implementation classes. These classes are extensible and regenerable - you can modify them by adding user-defined methods and instance variables. When the model changes, you can regenerate the implementation classes, and your modifications will be retained. This works both ways - changes in the Java code can be used to update the model.

<h3>Why is an eclipse plug-in needed</h3>


<h4>How does the plug-in work</h4>
<p>The plug-in uses the old, JacobGen 0.7, c++ program (dll) which reads in Microsoft's proprietary TLB files and writes out what it finds on stdout.  
From the information gathered from the TLB / stdout, the plug-in produces an ecore model based of what is found inside the TLB.  
At this point the plug-in has created a model of what's inside the DLL file.  
I.E.  what classes and enums exist. 
</p>

<p>From there, this is sketchy for now, the plug-in will use Java Emitter Templates (JET2) to generate java code based on the above ecore model.  
I hope JET2 can also generate java method bodies for the above model / java code. 
Why are method bodies important...   
I hope JET2 can generate method bodies to automatically call JACOB methods with the correct parameters.  
This will create a strongly typed java proxy, via JACOB, into the windows DLL.</p>

<p>So to wrap up.  The plug-in reads the TLB file (using the existing JacobGEN DLL), creates a model based on the TLB / DLL file, and then produces a java proxy.  
The JET2 generated classes are really a proxy into the DLL via JACOB.  
So the end result is a set of java classes hiding all JACOB internal knowledge. </p>
